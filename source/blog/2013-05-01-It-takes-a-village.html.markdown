This was taken at the end of my book release party on February 2nd of this year. I had only sold a handful of copies at that point, and was feeling more than a little insecure about the future of the book (and, by extension, my future as a storyteller). Thoroughly lost in all these questions, I set up the party. Just an excuse to go out, have a few drinks with friends, and try to have some fun. 

But when so many came out to show their support, it really drove something home for me. Each of them had been right there and ready to contribute the whole time. A word of encouragement here, some advice or feedback there. Some of their stories and experiences had even inspired parts in the book. And every time my faith had begun to flag during the process, they never failed to believe *for* me.

My deepest thanks to all of you. Those pictured here, those who couldn't make it, and to the fine people of Reddit and Imgur who have totally blown me away with their kindness and enthusiasm.

You guys are the shit!

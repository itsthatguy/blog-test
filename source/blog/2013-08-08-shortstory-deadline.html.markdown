Christopher grabbed the corner of his desk and pulled, launching into the twenty-fifth consecutive spin of his ergo-chair. The silky smooth motion of the ball-bearings didn't seem to notice his slender, feather-weight frame. Drifting in the perpetual circle soothed him somewhat, but there was no getting around it. He was stuck.

Landing a Design job at Fiero Games had been his ultimate goal. A high, distant mountain peak that had taken all his years at college and five years of ass-kissing and due-paying to reach. Yet now, after all the social-media congrats and free drinks downtown had gone, he had a deadline.

Christopher's Neural interface hovered before him, projected directly into his brain's vision centers by a litany of middle-range nanotech augments. The open app windows remained fixed to his view as his 164th floor office spun around him. Inviting buttons glowed in their false light, ready for input at blank welcome screens. There was Neofuse Pro, Extractogon, Immersion Studio T3K...tens of thousands of credits worth of top-of-the-line wetware licenses, and the power to extract human sensation to craft countless gaming experiences. *Too bad there's no setting for inspiration.*

He was assigned to the team working on UptOwn, Fiero's flagship title and chief cash cow. Subscribers each had their own virtual high-rise villa in the clouds and could fill it with whatever nonsense they wanted. In his own villa, Christopher was proudest of his pod of aristocratic manatees in the 60,000 gallon living room aquarium. Each manatee was fluent in Italian, making for hilarious in-aquarium exchanges. The love-triangle drama between Mario, Luigi, and Signori Pants had been heating up in the past few days.

But, as it turned out, the addition of available UptOwn features was a pretty dry process of demographic research, focus-group data analysis, and monetization proposals. Coming up with a random feature was fun and easy. Fitting it into the company's Bottom Line was not.
Early documentation on a set of Penguin Butlers blurred as he became suddenly dizzy. He stopped the rotation of his ergo-chair. Pinched his eyes shut.

“Normalize,” Christopher muttered, waving a boney hand in frustration. A slight vibration in his temples acknowledged the command, and the sensation stopped. Without looking, he minimized the apps to the periphery bar and turned toward the office windows. Blinked his aching eyes open.

A pitiful rain had fallen, snaking down the glass in jagged patterns blown by high-altitude winds. The reality of the hazy City beyond took a moment to come into focus. Pre-lunch aerial traffic of the Whitlatch neighborhood wove through the towers and megastructures in silent, dotted branches. Skybridges and plazas swarmed with shopping pedestrians. Signs superimposed on the shops and buildings invaded his Neural, offering small touch-prompts that tugged him back into the virtual world. Times like this, he thought about diving into his settings and disabling the Always-On mode. To just disconnect, even if for a moment. *Can't afford to.* He needed something to present to his Producer by end-of-day. Anything.

BING! A chat notification bounced out of his periphery bar and scared the shit out of him. Childish anger faded when he saw the profile picture. It was Andrew from the art department down the hall. A young, oval face with a wise-ass smile, lazy stubble beard, and a mop of curly blonde locks dangling over the brow. Christopher sighed. Too bad Andy was straight.

*<Early lunch? :D>* was all it said. Andy had gone out of his way to make sure Christopher, as the new guy, felt welcome and appreciated. Christopher had taken that for flirting at first, but then noticed Andy was that way with everyone. *Popular AND cute...* Just like all the other charming, quirky, painfully hetero guys from Sedonia Technical Arts Center. Christopher tapped the pop-up, prompting the curved Neural keyboard to manifest in front of him. He hesitated a moment in front of the hovering, empty text field. Started typing.

*<I'm tempted, but I should keep at it...the more breaks I take the less I'll get done--->* Christopher shook his head and held down the delete key. Started over.

*<Thanks man, but I really need to--->* He deleted again.

*<Hell yes! Take me away from all this.>* Christopher hit 'SEND,' sighed, and then smiled. The immediate knock on his office door startled him. There stood Andy, making a show of peering pig-nosed and cross-eyed against the frosted glass. Christopher grinned, fluttering a little inside. *Fucking artists...*

The ride out to Tsushi-nami was cramped in Andy's lime-green, hatchback Z-Glider. Ellie from HR and Fitz from Engineering were along for the ride, and Fitz, being a giant laughing gorilla of a man, got shotgun by default. Even with the seat pushed back for maximum leg-room, the guy's knees touched the dash. Christopher, the smallest of the group, was crammed in the backseat behind Fitz. He could still creep on Andy from there, but that was a sad consolation prize...and something smelled funny in the tattered upholstery. Andy had two french bulldogs. Apparently they were frequent passengers.

Christopher made an effort to involve himself in the conversation, but it seemed to revolve around office politics and daily drama. Who from HR did what with who from Engineering at the company Halloween party. Who was about to get fired from IT. Who was slacking off in the Art Department, checking in touched-up Simulations they'd found online. Gossip, Christopher noted, can be useful to learn on the first day but damn difficult to absorb with no frame of reference.

He zoned out, peering through the canopy bubble at the lines of passing traffic. Most seemed to flee the Whitlatch business sector at this time of day, passing quietly into the foggy superstructure canyons of the Inner Ring. *Tropical fish on the search for fresh feeding grounds...*

“So Chris!” Fitz bellowed, snapping Christopher out of the metaphor, “Any sneak previews on the fresh hell you guys got cookin' up in Design?”

A sore subject. Christopher bristled. “Something's taking shape, yeah,” he lied. Fitz snorted and turned back to face the cockpit.

“Taking shape...meaning us Engine guys'll probably be on sixteen-hour-days when overtime hits. I got half a mind to log a complaint with HR right now,” said Fitz, reaching a playful paw back at Ellie. She grabbed his thumb and bent it back toward his wrist. He yanked his arm away so hard it shook the hatchback.

“Whoa! Easy big fellah,” said Andy, correcting their flight pattern to match traffic, “Not only can she get you fired, she'll crush your money-makers too.”

A few significant glances darted between Ellie, Christopher, and Fitz.

“Dammit, his *hands*. For programming. He ain't making much with the other bits,” said Andy.

“Just trouble,” said Fitz. Everyone had a good laugh.

“Assholes...” Andy turned the wheel to dip out of traffic on approach to the Whitlatch Plaza Foodcourt.

In place of the normal ant colony of customers lined up at gourmet kiosks, a mob of bodies filled almost the entire semi-circular platform. Giant painted banners and clusters of multicolored placards waved above the crowd, taunting the three SCPD drones that formed a silent perimeter around them. The little bots looked more like harmless appliances, glossy blue with reflective yellow insignias. Smooth and shiny. No apparent weapons. Still and calm, their only motion was the smooth gimbal rotation of their belly-mounted cameras.

Christopher looked at the mob and squinted to make out the protest signs, prompting his Neural to enhance the text:

'Representation NOW!'
'Stay out of our heads! Jobs instead!'
'This is OUR CITY! Equal access for all!'

“Uh oh,” said Fitz, “Trouble on Lunch Island...any other ideas?” Andy waved him off.

“You underestimate my lust for Tsushi-nami, good sir!”

“Yeah, calm down, Fitzy, things look peaceful enough down there. Big guy like you shouldn't be scared of a little tear gas anyway,” said Ellie, rubbing Fitz's buzzed head as Andy dipped into the parking deck bay.

“Could be wasabi flavored,” Christopher ventured. Everyone shot a glance at him, looked at one another, and nodded. Andy pulled the Z-Glider into a space in the vertical wall of compartments. Landed with a matter-of-fact puff of the attitude jets.
“He'll do well here, I think,” said Andy.
“Agreed,” Fitz and Ellie replied together. Christopher smiled to himself as his harness retracted and the Glider canopy opened.

Ellie's assessment of the protest seemed accurate as the four of them stepped out of the garage elevator and onto the Plaza. There were no skinny hoodlums with bandana masks and molotov cocktails like the Slum riots on the news. It was a gathering of roughly 200 mothers, fathers, children, teens, homeless, middle class, and elderly; all holding their signs and shouting their chants in the light, late-morning rain.

No one bothered the four lunch-goers as they approached the art deco facade of Tsushi-nami. Andy's eyes went wide. Only two people in line at the end of a long, roped-off queue area.

“Holy shit, *thank you* civil disobedience!” Andy said as he swung under each rope like a spider monkey, making his way to the front. The rest followed like normal people.
The Tsushi-nami menu popped-up in Christopher's Neural as he entered the queue. He tapped it, surrounding himself in a ring of delicious options. The Special Maki sushi appeared front and center. With every swipe of his hand, a new 3-dimensional sushi roll rotated in front of him. The descriptions, and the real-time taste simulations, made his stomach growl.

*<The Cosmic Prawn: Tempura shrimp, crab salad, mango, cantaloupe, and goma dressing>*

*<The Crunchy Deckard: Soft shell crab, spicy yellowtail, kaiware, crispy noodles, spicy mayo>*

*<The Big Ka-tuna: Spicy tuna, avacado, cream cheese, jalapeno, lightly fried, with eel sauce>*

Seeing the words 'cheese,' 'jalapeno,' and 'fried' made Christopher's hand dart out for the button. After tapping 'Confirm Purchase,' he watched his profile picture attach to the menu selection and pop behind the other orders in the queue. The task bar underneath couldn't move fast enough.

Andy, Fitz, and Ellie were halfway through stuffing their faces as Christopher made it to the picnic table with his Big Ka-tuna.

“Chris! My brother!” Andy mumbled through swollen cheeks. He gulped an uncomfortably large mouthful. “Sit! For the love of God, sit down and enjoy this feast!”

Christopher tore into his sushi. The first taste made his eyes roll back. He hadn't been able to afford such things on a Game Tester's wages, and still felt a pang of buyer's remorse at the expense. But now he was on a Designer salary... *Fuck it.* He took his time with each roll, savoring the flavor and the success.

It was short-lived. With all of them quietly gorging themselves, the sounds of the protest took center stage. Christopher's chewing slowed as a chant picked up through the whole crowd.

“Trans-por-ta-tion! Passes now for Whitlatch Station! Trans-por-ta-tion! Passes now for Whitlatch Station! Trans-por-ta-tion! Passes now for Whitlatch Station!”

Christopher swallowed the last of a roll and looked at the others. Their mood had soured too, but they kept eating anyway...maybe a bit faster to finish up and get going. Christopher cleared his throat and spoke up. “What're they talking about? What's going on?”

Fitz gave a quick shrug of his broad, sagging shoulders.
“Must've been another price-hike on the Superway rates,” he said, putting down his chopsticks.
 
Ellie felt the question coming and paused her next mouthful. “Yeah...not enough jobs in this sector to go around, and it's getting tough for some to pay for the commute.”

“Oh,” said Christopher. He turned in his seat and looked at the crowd. Spied a mother with two young kids, a boy and a girl, beside her. All three looked exhausted. Frail. Kids their age were usually running a million miles an hour, flitting through at least twelve windows each in their Neu feeds. They were part of the UptOwn demographic after all...the Penguin Butlers targeted their age range. Except these kids just sat there, holding crudely drawn signs over their skinny legs. Not a Neural window in sight. The mother did her best to hold her sign high, chanting loudly with the crowd.

“See?” Andy blurted, “It *was* a good thing we bought our lunch here! Gotta support the locals...” Andy took an awkward sip of his soda. Fitz and Ellie cracked smiles, but Christopher furrowed his brow. *Not so cute anymore...*

A sudden stir among the protesters caught Christopher's eye. A scruffy, plain kid in his early twenties climbed up on a table, waiving two placards in the air at one of the drones. He screamed at the top of his lungs. Christopher had to pitch his Neural to hear above the open-air white noise of the City.

“HEY YOU!” the protester shouted into the wind, “You watching behind the camera! Stop hiding behind that fucking machine and just talk to us! HEY!”

A high-pitched buzzing followed within moments. Two more drones circled the plaza and joined the first three. In perfect, mechanical unison, they formed a pentagram around the mob. *There's no one watching.* Christopher realized. *Those are AI...this is an automated response.* Anger and fear surged through the protesters.

**<Disperse now. Disperse now. Disperse now.>**

Christopher winced, suppressing the sudden urge to take off running. The phrase repeated over and over in his mind. It wasn't like a text or an audio message...more like a cold, hard thought, shoved into his awareness. Everyone felt it.

“Ooookay, time to go,” said Andy, boxing up the rest of his Crunchy Deckard. Christopher and the others nodded and followed suit, pushing their chairs out.

They made it halfway to the elevators when Christopher saw a shiny object streak through the air. A glass bottle. The crowd went dead quiet as it spun in an arc toward one of the drones. The hover-bot banked right, dodged the projectile, and returned to formation. Around the pentagram, small panels clicked open under all five pairs of wings.

“RUN!” yelled Fitz as yellow jets of smoke fired into the thick of the crowd. The stuff spread over the plaza in seconds, turning the air into an acrid fume. Panic. Christopher felt his throat constrict. His eyes gushed thick, stinging tears. As he coughed and gasped, he dropped his to-go box on the concrete, breaking it open. Big Ka-tuna maki rolled away and broke apart at his feet. Someone grabbed his shirt.

“This way!” It was Ellie's voice. He clutched her soft, small hand as it dragged him onward. Every ragged breath stoked fire in his lungs, making escape the only thought in his mind. The only thought of his own, anyway.

**<Disperse now. Disperse now. Disperse now.>**

Christopher became aware of a crush of bodies all around him, pushing and shoving to get off of the plaza. Unable to see, he heard voices everywhere. Coughing. Cries of pain. Desperate shouts for the names of strangers. Christopher winced as he felt his foot come down on something soft. Jumped as he heard the scream.

Ellie's hand slipped in his grasp, flushing fresh panic through him. He reached out with his wild free hand and grabbed her by the wrist. Almost took her down. “*Holy shit*, Chris!” shrieked Ellie.

“Elevators are locked down!” yelled Fitz from further ahead, “Head for the ramp!”

The crowd thinned as they neared the plaza's edge. Christopher felt the platform started to slope beneath his feet, indicating the curve down and around to the garage's skywalk access. Swaying and disoriented, he followed the others in a stumbling run. Twelve levels down.

They arrived at Andy's Z-Glider and the passenger canopy slid up and back. Christopher hesitated as went to get in, suddenly nauseous. Bracing on the side of the Glider, he heaved, doubled-over, and spilled his lunch on the deck. He felt Ellie's hand on his back. The Glider started up.

“Guys...please...” said Andy above the hum of the engine.

“Jesus, Andy, give him a seco--”

“Okay--” Christopher spat, coughed, “I'm okay, let's go.” He dropped himself into a heap in the back seat. Smooth silence closed around them as the canopy hissed shut and formed the air seal. He felt a vibration in his temples. Another alien thought hijacked his attention.

**<Thank you for your cooperation.>**

The 'voice,' he could tell, had been programmed to soothe and reassure its recipient. An emotive multiplier effect...something he used often in Immersion Studio T3K. Under the weight of that realization, and the burning ache throughout his body, Christopher felt neither soothed nor reassured.

The flight back to the studio passed without a word from anyone.

The four of them made quite a scene entering the plush Fiero Games lobby. Eyes red and puffy, faces covered in tears and snot, and each of them coated in a fine layer of greasy yellow film. All of this glared against the high glass backdrop of the vaulted main entrance. They shuffled across the mock hardwood floors in a daze as the giant holo-projection of the winking, monacled UptOwn Tycoon presided over the scene.

Word of the coworker refugees spread like wild-fire, and soon enough, most of the office came down to investigate. Scott Fiero, owner and CEO of the company, included. The fit, thirty-something entrepreneur pushed through to the front and turned to address the gathering audience.

“Okay, everybody, give 'em some space! Back to your desks! Terry, could you bring some towels and water bottles?” As Scott commanded, the office obeyed. They shuffled back into the halls among a flurry of whispers.
“Andy...” said Scott, “What the hell happened?”

While Andy relayed the whole story in wild, dramatic gestures, Christopher excused himself and sat on one of the red pleather couches that flanked the front door. Terry, the mousey receptionist, appeared after a moment with water and a towel for him. Christopher took the bottle, rasped a 'thank you,' and upended it over his face. The cool liquid felt amazing, but the burning waned only somewhat. It prickled back to the surface as soon as the pouring stopped. He wiped the raw skin of his face as best he could and drank the rest of the bottle.

Breathless, Andy finished talking with a giant swig. Scott shook his head. “Holy shit guys... All of you, *go home*. Get cleaned up, take the day. I'll even arrange a cab for each of you if you're not feeling good to fly.”

Everyone nodded in thanks, and moved for the door. As Christopher stood on shaky legs, he saw Scott look at him. The CEO hesitated a moment then approached.
“Hell of a first day, huh?” asked Scott. 

Christopher laughed. It hurt. “Yeah...” he winced.
 
“Yeah... Listen...hmm, this is awkward,” Scott paused to collect his thoughts. “I meant what I said. You're more than welcome to head home for the day. But...if you were feeling up to staying, we could *really* use your help. This milestone is already two weeks behind, and we are *right* up against the ship date. If this release goes over, we stand to take a pretty big hit.”

Christopher swayed, staring a hole through the floor behind Scott. *Penguin Butlers...* He hadn't thought the idea could seem more ridiculous. Now he was covered in snot and tear gas, contemplating what he'd need to do to finish the pricing models for cummerbunds, bow-ties, and handle-bar beak-staches. The starving family back on the Plaza flashed through his memory. Penguin butlers certainly wouldn't help them, but would going home? Would quitting? He didn't just have a good job, he had his dream job. And, as insane as it felt, here was an opportunity to make a big first impression with the boss. Job security. Not an easy thing to come by in the worst recession since the early 21st century. *Besides, a little ridiculous work might feel good right about now.*

“I can stay,” he said. The phrase turned his stomach as all his justifications suddenly dried up. *Really, Christopher? Really?* Too late now to take it back.

“Oh man, thank you, Christopher! Believe me, I don't forget a favor. Feel free to take your time getting back to it...there are showers in the first level bathrooms by the gym for you to rinse off. I'll have Terry run out and get you some clean clothes to wear. Whatever brands you want,” Scott raised a hand to pat Christopher on the shoulder, then thought better of it. He turned and strode into a brisk walk down the hall. “You're my savior! Thanks Chris!”

“No problem,” Christopher muttered. Left alone in the lobby with the UptoWn Tycoon grinning down at him like a maniac, he hung his head. Squinted. A strange spot on the sole of his right sneaker caught his attention. He furrowed his brow and lifted his foot to look. A wet, red stain covered the bottom.

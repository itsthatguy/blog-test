As the spiritual center and dwindling primary watersource for the slums' Rasalla District, *the Stepstones* attracts thousands of dwellers each day. It is where the Prologue takes place.

##Characters Portrayed
- __*The Blue Ladies*__ - "Build shelter how you can. Pray for rain." The Blue Ladies are priestesses of the river, pleading to all Gods and holy energies for water, plenty, and salvation. They dress in clothing dyed with the rarest blue pigment, representing the hope for the color to return to the sky.
- __*Grandsellers*__ - After reaching an age where they can no longer labor, elderly Rasalla women offer their services to the Stepstones, selling candles set on aluminum flowers to carry dweller prayers down-stream.
